It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notifications of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\u201cDMCA\u201d) of 1998, the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.copyright.gov\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">website<\/a>.

Fair use states that brief excerpts of copyrighted material may, under certain circumstances, be quoted verbatim for purposes such as criticism, news reporting, teaching, and research, without the need for permission from or payment to the copyright holder. If you have considered fair use, and you still wish to continue with a copyright complaint, you may want to first reach out to the user in question to see if you can resolve the matter directly with the user.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please note that if you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a notification with us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may, at our discretion or as required by law, share a copy of your notification or counter-notification with third parties. This may include sharing the information with the account holder engaged in the allegedly infringing activity or for publication. If you are concerned about your information being forwarded, you may wish to&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.copyrighted.com\/professional-takedowns\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">use an agent<\/a>&nbsp;to report infringing material for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"notifications-of-infringement\">Notifications of infringement<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any material available on our Services infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a written copyright infringement notification (\u201cNotification\u201d) using the contact details below pursuant to the DMCA. All such Notifications must comply with the DMCA requirements. You may refer to a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.websitepolicies.com\/create\/dmca-takedown-notice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DMCA takedown notice generator<\/a>\u00a0or other similar services to avoid making mistakes and ensure compliance of your Notification.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these requirements, our response may include the removal or restriction of access to allegedly infringing material as well as a permanent termination of repeat infringers\u2019 accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate any account in response to a notification of alleged infringement, we will make a good faith effort to contact the affected user with information concerning the removal or restriction of access, which may include a full copy of your Notification (including your name, address, phone, and email address).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this Policy, the Operator reserves the right to take no action upon receipt of a DMCA copyright infringement notification if it fails to comply with all the requirements of the DMCA for such notifications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process described in this Policy does not limit our ability to pursue any other remedies we may have to address suspected infringement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"changes-and-amendments\">Changes and amendments<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to the Website and Services at any time at our discretion. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page.

Your continued use of the Website and Services after the effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"reporting-copyright-infringement\">Reporting copyright infringement<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to notify us of the infringing material or activity, we encourage you to contact us using the details below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>gndec.aces@gmail.com<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This document was last updated on January 26, 2022<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Content and Copyright policy DMCA policy This Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy (\u201cPolicy\u201d) applies to the\u00a0https:\/\/aces.gndec.ac.in\u00a0website (\u201cWebsite\u201d or \u201cService\u201d) and any of its related products and services (collectively, \u201cServices\u201d) and outlines how this Website operator (\u201cOperator\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) addresses copyright infringement notifications and how you (\u201cyou\u201d or \u201cyour\u201d) may submit a copyright infringement [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.4.1 -
